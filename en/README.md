# Data science before coding

This repository was planned for those who don't know how to code, but work or want to work with data science 🙃

> If you already code and want a repo with a faster pace, check out [this one](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/datascience_one_2019_1) 😎

### Disclaimer

This is a collaborative repository, created by the students of [Instituto Metrópole Digital](imd.ufrn.br) from [UFRN](ufrn.br).

The author of each notebook is properly acknowledged 😉 

## Choosing a tool

Several tools are available for this profile.

In general, they can be grouped into GUI tools and CLI tools:
- GUI (graphical user interface): All the user interaction is done graphically. These are software like Google Spreadsheets and [Orange3](https://orange.biolab.si). 
- CLI (command-line interface): User interaction is done through a programming language. The main open source languages used in data science are Python, R, and Julia.

A very nice alternative that gathers a bit of both worlds are interactive notebooks, originally from project Jupyter and currently supported also by Google Colaboratory.

[This post](https://medium.com/@leobezerra_90682/python-r-messi-and-cristiano-d2b5278dbd5a) discusses the main supported languages.

In this repo, we will use notebooks with the Python ecossystem and its main library, Pandas.

> The whole material was planned so you don't need to learn how to code, but if you do want to, check out this [this repo](https://github.com/leobezerra/python-zero).

> The notebooks in this repository were either created or translated by the authors indicated.
